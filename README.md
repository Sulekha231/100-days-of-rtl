# 100-days-of-rtl
Hello my name is Sulekha.

Welcome to my #100DaysOfRTL challenge! For the next 100 days, I will be dedicating time each day to learn and practice RTL design.

# Goals
My main goals for this challenge are:

To gain a deep understanding of RTL design techniques
To be able to implement RTL designs from scratch
To work on a personal RTL design project and bring it to completion

# Rules
To ensure that I stay on track during this challenge, I will be following these rules:

I will dedicate at least 1 hour per day to studying and practicing RTL design.
I will share my progress on social media every day using the hashtag #100DaysOfRTL.
I will document my progress in a daily log, which will be included in this repo.
I will work on a personal RTL design project throughout the challenge.

# Progress Tracking
I will be tracking my progress throughout the challenge in this repo. Each day, I will update my daily log to reflect what I learned and what progress I made. I will also include any resources or tools that I used that day.

# Resources
During the challenge, I will be using the following resources:
